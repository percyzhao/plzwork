        <h1> Support </h1>
        <p> Support, as the name implies has a role to support their team, mainly their bot laner. They also go to the bot lane and will not kill minions for gold and experience. Instead, they will either heal and shield their bot laner, or help to engage fights for their bot laner. I&rsquo;ll be talking about 2 supports.<a href = "#pyke"> Pyke,</a> and <a href = "#blitzcrank"> Blitzcrank.</a></p>

        <h2> Basic Abilities</h2>
        <h3> Pyke&rsquo;s passive is Gift Of The Drowned Ones. When Pyke takes damage, he stores a portion of damage taken as grey health. This grey health does not count towards actual health, but will convert to actual health once Pyke is not seen by anyone on the enemy team. </h3>
        <h3> Pyke&rsquo;s first basic ability is Bone Skewer. If Pyke taps the ability, he will stab directly in front of him, dealing damage. If Pyke holds the ability, he charges a long range projectile. If he hits an enemy champion, he pulls them towards him. </h3>
        <h3> Pyke&rsquo;s second basic ability is Ghostwater Dive. Pyke dives, gaining movement speed and making himself invisible for 5 seconds. Enemies can only see him if they are within a certain distance of Pyke.</h3>
        <h3>Pyke&rsquo;s third basic ability is Phantom Undertow. Pyke dashes, and lives behind a phantom where he once was. After a delay, the phantom returns to Pyke, stunning all units between them.</h3>
        <h3>Ultimate</h3>
        <h3>Pyke&rsquo;s ultimate is Death from Below. Pyke strikes an area in an X shaped formation. He executes any low health champions and blinks to them. If he kills the champion, the cooldown of this ability is reset and allows him to cast his ultimate again.</h3>
        <h1 id = "blitzcrank"> Vex</h1>
        <img class = "rift" src = "blitzcrank.jpeg" alt = "Picture of the champion Karthus"/>
        <h2> Basic Abilities</h2>
        <h3> Blitzcrank&rsquo;s passive is Mana Barrier. Blitzcrank gains a shield while low health based on how much maximum mana he has.</h3>
        <h3> Blitzcrank&rsquo;s first basic ability is Rocket Grab. Blitzcrank fires his hand out, grabbing any enemy hit and pulling them to him.</h3>
        <h3> Blitzcrank&rsquo;s second basic ability is Overdirve. Blitzcrank gains movement speed and attack speed for a couple of seconds, but afterwards he is slowed slightly.</h3>
        <h3> Blitzcrank&rsquo;s third basic ability is Power Fist. Blitzcrank&rsquo;s next attack will do double damage and knock up the target hit.</h3>
        <h3> Ultimate</h3>
        <h3> Blitzcrank&rsquo;s ultimate is Static Field. Blitzcrank creates a circle of electricity, dealing damage to all enemies around him as well as slowing and removing their sheilds. </h3>
