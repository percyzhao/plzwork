        <h1> Jungle </h1>
        <p> Jungle is quite different than all of the other roles. Instead of farming minions for gold and exp, you defeat jungle monsters. However, that is not your only job. Junglers will also gank other lanes to try and scores. This sets the enemy laner behind and gets you and your laners ahead. This is extremely vital to winning games. You also need to take objectives on the map. These objectives are Dragon, Rift Herald, and Baron. Taking Dragon gives your team a small permanent buff. Taking Rift Herald lets you summon the Rift Herald to destroy enemy towers. Taking Baron will empower your minions to make them stronger and have more hp. Jungle is a role with high impact on everyone else in the game, so it&rsquo;s key they do their job well. I&rsquo;ll be talking about 2 different junglers, <a href = "#yi"> Master Yi,</a> and <a href = "#karthus"> Karthus.</a></p>
